OpenPose: Real-time multi-person keypoint detection library for body, face, hands, and foot estimation


## geohot/tinygrad
### https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad
For something in between a pytorch and a karpathy/micrograd.

This may not be the best deep learning framework, but it is a deep learning framework.


## imgclsmob

Sandbox for training deep learning networks


## huggingface/transformers
### https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
Transformers: State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.
Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio.

These models can be applied on:

📝 Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, in over 100 languages.
🖼️ Images, for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
🗣️ Audio, for tasks like speech recognition and audio classification.
Transformer models can also perform tasks on several modalities combined, such as table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

## Tencent/ncnn
### https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn
ncnn is a high-performance neural network inference computing framework optimized for mobile platforms. ncnn is deeply considerate about deployment and uses on mobile phones from the beginning of design. ncnn does not have third party dependencies. it is cross-platform, and runs faster than all known open source frameworks on mobile phone cpu. Developers can easily deploy deep learning algorithm models to the mobile platform by using efficient ncnn implementation, create intelligent APPs, and bring the artificial intelligence to your fingertips. ncnn is currently being used in many Tencent applications, such as QQ, Qzone, WeChat, Pitu and so on.

ncnn 是一个为手机端极致优化的高性能神经网络前向计算框架。ncnn 从设计之初深刻考虑手机端的部署和使用。无第三方依赖，跨平台，手机端 cpu 的速度快于目前所有已知的开源框架。基于 ncnn，开发者能够将深度学习算法轻松移植到手机端高效执行，开发出人工智能 APP，将 AI 带到你的指尖。ncnn 目前已在腾讯多款应用中使用，如 QQ，Qzone，微信，天天P图等。


## Tencent/TNN
### https://github.com/Tencent/TNN

TNN: A high-performance, lightweight neural network inference framework open sourced by Tencent Youtu Lab. It also has many outstanding advantages such as cross-platform, high performance, model compression, and code tailoring. The TNN framework further strengthens the support and performance optimization of mobile devices on the basis of the original Rapidnet and ncnn frameworks. At the same time, it refers to the high performance and good scalability characteristics of the industry's mainstream open source frameworks, and expands the support for X86 and NV GPUs. On the mobile phone, TNN has been used by many applications such as mobile QQ, weishi, and Pitu. As a basic acceleration framework for Tencent Cloud AI, TNN has provided acceleration support for the implementation of many businesses. Everyone is welcome to participate in the collaborative construction to promote the further improvement of the TNN reasoning framework.
