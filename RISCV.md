## vivado-risc-v
### https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v
Xilinx Vivado block designs for FPGA RISC-V SoC running Debian Linux distro.

This repository contains FPGA prototype of fully functional RISC-V Linux server with networking, online Linux package repository and daily package updates. It includes scripts and sources to generate RISC-V SoC HDL, Xilinx Vivado project, FPGA bitstream, and bootable SD card. The SD card contains RISC-V Open Source Supervisor Binary Interface (OpenSBI), U-Boot, Linux kernel and Debian root FS. Linux package repositories and regular updates are provided by Debian. Over 90% of packages of the whole Debian collection are available for download.

## OpenXiangShan/XiangShan
### https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan
XiangShan (香山) is an open-source high-performance RISC-V processor project.

## YosysHQ/picorv32
### **++++**
### https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32
PicoRV32 is a CPU core that implements the RISC-V RV32IMC Instruction Set. It can be configured as RV32E, RV32I, RV32IC, RV32IM, or RV32IMC core, and optionally contains a built-in interrupt controller.

## lowRISC/ibex
### https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex
Ibex is a small 32 bit RISC-V CPU core, previously known as zero-riscy.


## cv32e40p
### https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p
CV32E40P is an in-order 4-stage RISC-V RV32IMFCXpulp CPU based on RI5CY from PULP-Platform

## cva6
### https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6
CVA6 is a 6-stage, single issue, in-order CPU which implements the 64-bit RISC-V instruction set. It fully implements I, M, A and C extensions as specified in Volume I: User-Level ISA V 2.3 as well as the draft privilege extension 1.10. It implements three privilege levels M, S, U to fully support a Unix-like operating system. Furthermore it is compliant to the draft external debug spec 0.13.

It has configurable size, separate TLBs, a hardware PTW and branch-prediction (branch target buffer and branch history table). The primary design goal was on reducing critical path length.
