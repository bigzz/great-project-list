## **TOP2:** vivado-risc-v
### https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v
Xilinx Vivado block designs for FPGA RISC-V SoC running Debian Linux distro.

This repository contains FPGA prototype of fully functional RISC-V Linux server with networking, online Linux package repository and daily package updates. It includes scripts and sources to generate RISC-V SoC HDL, Xilinx Vivado project, FPGA bitstream, and bootable SD card. The SD card contains RISC-V Open Source Supervisor Binary Interface (OpenSBI), U-Boot, Linux kernel and Debian root FS. Linux package repositories and regular updates are provided by Debian. Over 90% of packages of the whole Debian collection are available for download.
